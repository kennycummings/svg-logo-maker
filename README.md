# svg-logo-maker

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to generate a logo for projects to forego the need of a graphic designer.

## Features

You can input up to three characters for the text, select a shape, and finally input a color of the shape. The logo is generated when the prompt is completed.

## Functionality

This web application prompts the user for text, shape, and color of the shape. Based on the selected shape, it creates an instance of the corresponding class, applies the chosen color to the shape, and generates a scalable vector graphic.
